#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured and efficient way. It’s important because it helps build reliable, scalable, and high-quality software that powers everything from websites and mobile apps to complex systems like banking and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1950s-60s: Birth of Software Engineering – Software development started as a discipline, and structured programming was introduced.
1970s-80s: Waterfall Model & Object-Oriented Programming – The Waterfall model became popular, and OOP (like Java & C++) improved code organization.
2000s-Present: Agile & DevOps – Agile methods replaced Waterfall for flexibility, and DevOps improved collaboration between development and operations.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Define project goals and feasibility.
Requirement Analysis – Gather what the software needs to do.
Design – Create the architecture and UI/UX.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code.
Testing – Ensure the software works as expected.
Deployment – Release the software to users.
Maintenance – Fix bugs and update the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A step-by-step, linear process (e.g., used in government or large construction projects where requirements don’t change).
Agile: A flexible, iterative approach with fast feedback (e.g., used in startups or app development, where changes are frequent).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes and maintains code.
Quality Assurance Engineer (QA): Tests software to find bugs.
Project Manager: Plans, organizes, and ensures the project is completed on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ) – Help developers write and debug code efficiently.
VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub) – Track changes and allow teamwork without losing progress.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging Issues → Use logging and debugging tools.
Meeting Deadlines → Plan with realistic timelines.
Keeping Up with New Technologies → Continuous learning through courses and practice.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests small code parts (e.g., testing a login function).
Integration Testing – Ensures different parts of the system work together.
System Testing – Tests the whole application before release.
Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets customer requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing clear and effective instructions (prompts) to get accurate and relevant responses from AI models. It’s important because better prompts lead to better AI-generated results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved Prompt: Can you explain the difference between electric and gasoline cars in terms of performance and environmental impact?
Why it’s Better? It’s specific (focuses on electric vs. gasoline), clear (asks for performance & environmental impact), and concise (no unnecessary words).
